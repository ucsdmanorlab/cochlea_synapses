#01_data:
##3 conversion scripts:
convert_and_sort.py - converts and sorts into validation and training
convert_and_sort_with_scaling.py - same as convert_and_sort but also reads in resolution information (created wit getResolution.ijm FIJI macro) so that images are later scaled before training/prediction
convert_from_labels.py - converts files with label data (the above two take in binary segmentation and create labels)

#02_train:
setup01 - input = raw, output = binary segmentation
setup02 - same as setup01, with additional augmentation and with all data converted to 8-bit
setup03 - input = raw, output = sdt; images scaled to same pixel size
setup04 - input = raw, output = sdt; images not scaled to same pixel size; mode=3d
setup05 - input = raw, output = affs
setup06 - input = raw; output = affs, lsds; images scaled to same pixel size
setup07 - input = raw; output = affs, lsds; images not scaled to same pixel size
setup08 - input = raw; output = affs, lsds; images not scaled to same pixel size; retrained on cleaned data; reject probability decreased
